Hello fellow human!

I am **Errol**, a seasoned software engineer with experience in building maintainable enterprise software.

Nothing much to see here since most of my work has been in private companies. I contribute occasionally to open source software that I consume like video addons and hacking my entertainment system.

My CV should give you an overview on what my career looks like:

Hello fellow human!

I am **Errol**, a software engineer with 10 years experience on building maintenable enterprise software.

Nothing much to see here since most of my work are in private companies. I sparingly contribute to open source software that I consume like video addons and hacking my entertainment system.

My CV should give you an overview on what my career looks like:
